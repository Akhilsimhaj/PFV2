Create, communicate, and capture value

- Let's discuss the prerequisites for value-based pricing. Simply speaking, in order to capture the value you deserve, you first need to generate superior customer insights. With these insights you need to co-create more value with your customers. Thirdly, this value needs to be communicated through your value proposition, your sales pitch, and your branding. These three steps help you to increase the customer's willingness to pay. Once the customer's willing to pay a bit more for your service or product then you can cash in on your advantages. Or as a pricing expert would say, you can capture the value you deserve. So the number one complaint that I hear from my participants at IMD when it comes to value-based pricing, is that they say we are better than the competitor, we have a strong brand, we have good people, we have good products, good services, but we lose deals on price. So despite the fact that we are better, we don't capture the value we co-create with our customers. And my response to these participants is two-fold. First, complaining won't help, okay? Welcome to the reality. There are competitors out there who will undercut your price. The second answer is it means that your customers are very smart. They get your superior product and service for the price of the lower cost competitor. It is your most important job to convince the customer of your superior value and to charge for it. We can illustrate this circle as an example. Let's take BMW, the German car maker. BMW has various means to generate customer insights. For example, they have dozens of sound engineers whose job it is to design the perfect sound in the car. For the ambitious driver, the engine must make this Formula 1 sound. For a family driver, the interior sound is less important. The kids take care of the noise anyway. For the sophisticated driver, the noise should be minimized to allow for a good stereo experience. In this example, sound engineers generate customer insight and co-create more value through a better driving experience. However, these advantages can only be cashed in if customers are aware of it. The marketing and sales approach of BMW is to attract potential buyers to the showroom for taking a test drive. This test drive together with the explanations communicate the superior value which increases the customer's willingness to pay. With this example in mind, define the circle for your own offerings, assess your strengths, but also where you lose out. If you have a better product but customers are not aware, this could indicate that you are not communicating the value convincingly enough. If you give too many discounts it can be a sign of poor pricing practices. In any case, don't try to optimize the capturing part in isolation. Value-based pricing requires that you are excellent

Compare value, not prices

- One important aspect of value-based pricing is to focus on the customer and not on the product or service you're selling. The customer's willingness to pay is high when you address a need better than any alternative product or solution. It is your job to ensure that the customers compare value, not prices. Once she only compares prices, the lowest price wins, and that's not what we want. One company I work with very closely is Bossard in Switzerland. It's a company in the fastening technology market. So we can say they sell screws, nuts, and bolts, but, of course, we call it fastening technology. But it's screws, nuts and bolts, and they sell 700,000 different types. So for many of the products, it's cost-based pricing because it wouldn't make much sense to do research of what we could charge. But for some screws, actually it's not cost-based pricing. But we try to understand what is the true value that this particular screw creates for the customer? To give you one example, Bossard has a patented technology to put lubricant on a screw, so it's a pre-lubricated screw. Let's assume that the cost for a regular screw is 10 cents, and Bossard sells it for 20 cents, delivered to the factory floor at the right time, the right quantity, and the right quality. Let's further assume that the cost of the pre-lubrication is another 10 cents. So the question is how much should Bossard charge for the pre-lubricated screw? Just add the 10 cents to make it 30 cents? Or double the price to 40 cents since the costs have doubled? Or can Bossard charge even 80 cents? The answer is it depends. Bossard needs to understand the value of this product compared to the customer's perceived next best alternative. We call this CuPeNeBa. The customer can buy a regular screw, buy lubricant, hire somebody to put lubricant on the screw, to check if the right amount of lubricant is applied, and to clean the mess. This cost is estimated to be 90 cents per screw mainly because of salary costs. This means that Bossard can charge anything between 30 cents to cover additional cost for pre-lubrication and 90 cents to CuPeNeBa. There is a huge difference between cost-based pricing and value-based pricing. Good salesperson understand these principles very well. Let's take the example of a clothing store. If I am interested in a suit for a job interview, my willingness to pay is quite high because my alternative, my CuPeNeBa, is to buy a cheap suit and fail at the job interview. Based on what we just learned, value-based pricing can be summarized in one simply sentence. You can never charge more than the customer's willingness to pay, but your price should never be much lower.
